# Comment-Driven Development with Copilot

## Learning Objective
Learn how to use descriptive comments to guide Copilot in generating the code you need.

## Instructions
1. Create a new Python file called `calculator.py`
2. Write detailed comments describing what you want the code to do
3. Let Copilot suggest the implementation based on your comments
4. Accept or modify the suggestions as needed

## Your Task
Write comments and let Copilot generate code for a simple calculator that can:
- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide two numbers (with error handling for division by zero)
- Take user input for operation choice and numbers

## Example Starting Comment
```python
# Simple calculator program
# Function to add two numbers
```

## What You'll Learn
- How clear, descriptive comments help Copilot understand your intent
- The importance of being specific in your descriptions
- How to break down complex tasks into smaller, commented sections

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Copilot generates working functions based on your comments
- [ ] The calculator handles user input correctly
- [ ] Division by zero is handled appropriately
- [ ] You understand how comment quality affects suggestion quality

## Tips for Better Results
- Be specific about input/output types
- Mention error handling requirements in comments
- Break complex logic into smaller commented steps
