# Design with Copilot: Building a C/C++ Build System

## Learning Objective
Learn how different approaches to AI-assisted development affect the quality and completeness of the final product. Compare direct implementation versus specification-first design when building complex software systems.

## Instructions
1. Create two separate implementations of the same build system
2. Use different AI collaboration approaches for each
3. Compare the results and learn from the differences
4. Understand the importance of specifications in AI-assisted development
5. Build a working build system tool

## Background: What is a Build System?
A build system automates the compilation and linking of source code into executables. Popular examples include Make, CMake, Bazel, and Ninja. Your tool, "Buildit", will be a simplified version that:
- Reads build configurations from a file
- Determines dependencies between targets
- Builds only what's necessary
- Executes build commands in the correct order

## Your Task

### Approach 1: Direct Implementation
Create a directory called `buildit-direct/` and implement the tool using only this specification:

```
The tool should accept a buildfile called `Buildit` in which the user
specifies targets and sources. The tool will read the `Buildit` file and
will determine which targets need to be built and in what order.

The tool should have a rich command line interface for building specific
targets, cleaning and anything else which is pertinent.

The tool should be written in C/C++.
```

Ask Copilot: "Build a C++ build system tool based on this specification"

### Approach 2: Specification-First Design
Create a directory called `buildit-spec/` and follow this process:

#### Step 1: Generate Detailed Specification
Ask Copilot: "Create a detailed technical specification for a C++ build system tool called Buildit with the following basic requirements: [paste the paragraph]. Include architecture, file formats, algorithms, and implementation details."

#### Step 2: Review and Refine Specification
Review the generated specification and ask Copilot to refine it:
- "Add support for parallel builds to the specification"
- "Include incremental build support based on file timestamps"
- "Add support for custom build rules and variables"
- "Include dependency graph visualization"

#### Step 3: Implement Based on Specification
Use the refined specification to guide implementation.

## Detailed Requirements

### Buildit File Format
The `Buildit` file should support:

```makefile
# Comments start with #
# Variables
CC = g++
FLAGS = -Wall -O2

# Target definition
target: dependencies
    command to execute
    another command

# Example:
main.exe: main.o utils.o
    $(CC) $(FLAGS) -o main.exe main.o utils.o

main.o: main.cpp utils.h
    $(CC) $(FLAGS) -c main.cpp

utils.o: utils.cpp utils.h
    $(CC) $(FLAGS) -c utils.cpp

# Special targets
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f *.o *.exe

.DEFAULT: all
all: main.exe
```

### Core Components to Implement

#### 1. Parser Module
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Implement a parser for Buildit files"
class BuildfileParser {
public:
    struct Target {
        std::string name;
        std::vector<std::string> dependencies;
        std::vector<std::string> commands;
        bool isPhony = false;
    };
    
    struct Variable {
        std::string name;
        std::string value;
    };
    
    std::map<std::string, Target> parse(const std::string& filename);
    std::string expandVariables(const std::string& text);
    
private:
    std::map<std::string, Variable> variables;
    // Let Copilot implement parsing logic
};
```

#### 2. Dependency Graph
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Create a dependency graph for build targets"
class DependencyGraph {
public:
    void addTarget(const std::string& name, 
                   const std::vector<std::string>& deps);
    
    std::vector<std::string> getTopologicalOrder();
    bool hasCycles() const;
    void visualize() const;
    
private:
    std::map<std::string, std::set<std::string>> adjacencyList;
    // Let Copilot implement graph algorithms
};
```

#### 3. Build Executor
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Implement build execution with timestamp checking"
class BuildExecutor {
public:
    enum BuildResult {
        SUCCESS,
        FAILURE,
        UP_TO_DATE
    };
    
    BuildResult build(const std::string& target);
    bool needsRebuild(const std::string& target, 
                      const std::vector<std::string>& deps);
    void executeCommand(const std::string& command);
    
private:
    std::time_t getModificationTime(const std::string& file);
    // Let Copilot implement build logic
};
```

#### 4. Command Line Interface
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Create a rich CLI for the build tool"
class CLI {
public:
    struct Options {
        std::string buildfile = "Buildit";
        std::string target = "all";
        bool verbose = false;
        bool dryRun = false;
        bool clean = false;
        bool parallel = false;
        int jobs = 4;
        bool showGraph = false;
    };
    
    Options parseArguments(int argc, char* argv[]);
    void printHelp();
    void printVersion();
};
```

### Advanced Features

#### Parallel Build Support
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Add parallel build execution using thread pool"
class ParallelExecutor {
public:
    ParallelExecutor(int numThreads);
    void buildParallel(const DependencyGraph& graph);
    
private:
    std::queue<std::string> readyQueue;
    std::mutex queueMutex;
    std::condition_variable cv;
    // Let Copilot implement thread pool
};
```

#### File Watching (Incremental Builds)
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Implement file watching for automatic rebuilds"
class FileWatcher {
public:
    void watch(const std::vector<std::string>& files);
    void onFileChange(std::function<void(const std::string&)> callback);
    
private:
    // Platform-specific implementation
    // Linux: inotify, macOS: FSEvents, Windows: ReadDirectoryChangesW
};
```

#### Build Cache
```cpp
// Ask Copilot: "Add build caching to avoid redundant compilations"
class BuildCache {
public:
    std::string getCacheKey(const std::string& command, 
                           const std::vector<std::string>& inputs);
    bool isCached(const std::string& key);
    void store(const std::string& key, const std::string& output);
    std::string retrieve(const std::string& key);
    
private:
    std::string cacheDir = ".buildit-cache/";
    // Let Copilot implement caching logic
};
```

- The value of detailed specifications in AI-assisted development
- How to guide AI tools effectively for complex projects
- Build system internals and algorithms
- C++ systems programming techniques

## Final Comparison Report

Create a report (`comparison.md`) documenting:
1. Implementation timelines for both approaches
2. Feature completeness comparison
3. Code quality assessment
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Lessons learned
6. Recommendations for future projects

This exercise demonstrates that while AI can quickly generate code from minimal specifications, taking time to develop comprehensive specifications leads to more robust, feature-complete, and maintainable software.
