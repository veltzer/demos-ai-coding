# Create a PasswordValidator class that makes the test pass
# Requirements from test:
# - validate(password) method that returns bool
# - get_errors() method that returns list of error messages
# - Must check password is at least 8 characters
# - Keep it simple - only implement what the test requires

class PasswordValidator:
    # Let AI implement
    pass
