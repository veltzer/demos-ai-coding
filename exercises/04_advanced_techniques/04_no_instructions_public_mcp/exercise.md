# Using a public/free MCP in your co-pilot

* Find a topic that interest you (movies, sports, ...)

* Find a public/free MCP that provides information on that topics.

* Find how to connect your VScode/copilot to any MCP.

* Find a question about your topics that the AI ***CANNOT ANSWER*** and has to search the web for.

* Connect the MCP you found to VScode/copilot.

* Now as your question again and see if the AI can answer it this time.
